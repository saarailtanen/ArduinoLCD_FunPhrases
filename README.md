# ArduinoLCD_FunPhrases
This was a quick project to test the arduino lcd screen. These phrases give out good spirit!

I used fritzing because we have used it in school and it is really good for Arduino wirings. 

For this project I used:
1x Arduino UNO
1x breadboard
1x LCD screen
1x button
1x potentiometer
1x 220 ohm resistor
1x 10k ohm resistor
and many wires

Black wires = ground
Red = 5V
Yellow = Data

How to use:
First you hard code your phrases. It starts with a welcome phrase. After this when you press the button it changes the phrase randomly. Potentiometer is used to control the contrast of the screen.
